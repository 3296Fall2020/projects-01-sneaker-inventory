## **Project Overview**

The Sneaker Inventory project is a website that will allow users to market their sneaker collection. While the intention of the site isn't to allow for actual resell, the goal is to have this webiste act as a repository for any of the many exeisting reselling sites. The fundamental features of this webiste include displaying and sharing sneaker inventories, as well as having access to other features such as current market value.

A HTML/CSS/VanillaJS (subject to change to React/Vue) front end will allow users to access and update details regarding their sneaker collection. This interface will  have a login page, inventory access not limited to adding, viewing, and sorting their collection based on a variety of filters. It will also allow users to upload pictures that will be associated with a specific entry. Users will also be able to see the current price of individual items or their whole collection based on data extracted from (StockX). Additionally, if time allows, there will be a feature for following other users and adding accessbility to their inventories. 

Data regarding sneaker collections will be stored in a MySQL database, and communication with the frontend will be aided by a Spring Boot web service. There will be data associated with a memberâ€™s personal account and details regarding their sneaker collection. Browser Automation of stockX to retrieve current market value will be done with Selenium web driver and Scaping will be done with JSoup or HtmlUnit. Member details for the database will include (Name, Account number to be used as primary key, date joined and a reference to their collection, number of items in collection). Data kept regarding sneakers includes (brand, model, SKU number, price, size and purchase date).
